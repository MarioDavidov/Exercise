The Player class should receive a name (string), hp (int) and mp (int) upon initialization. The Player also has 2 instance attributes: skills (empty dictionary by initialization â€“ will contain the skills of each player and its mana cost) and guild set to "Unaffiliated" by default.
The Player class should also have two methods:
-	add_skill(skill_name, mana_cost)
o	Add the skill and the corresponding mana cost to the dictionary of skills. Return "Skill {skill_name} added to the collection of the player {player_name}"
o	If the skill is already in the collection, return "Skill already added"
