''''
The Player class should receive a name (string), hp (int) and mp (int) upon initialization. The Player also has 2 instance attributes: skills (empty dictionary by initialization â€“ will contain the skills of each player and its mana cost) and guild set to "Unaffiliated" by default.
The Player class should also have two methods:
-	add_skill(skill_name, mana_cost)
o	Add the skill and the corresponding mana cost to the dictionary of skills. Return "Skill {skill_name} added to the collection of the player {player_name}"
o	If the skill is already in the collection, return "Skill already added"

-	player_info() 
o	Returns the player's information, including his/her skills, in this format:
"Name: {player_name}
 Guild: {guild_name}
 HP: {hp}
 MP: {mp}
 ==={skill_name_1} - {skill_mana_cost}
 ==={skill_name_2} - {skill_mana_cost}
 ...
 ==={skill_name_N} - {skill_mana_cost}"

The Guild class receive a name {string}. The Player should also have one instance attribute players (empty list by initialization which will contain the players of the guild). The class also has 3 methods:
-	assign_player(player: Player)
o	Add the player to the guild. Return "Welcome player {player_name} to the guild {guild_name}". Remember to change the player's guild in the player class.
o	If the player is already in the guild, return "Player {player_name} is already in the guild."
o	If the player is in another guild, return "Player {player_name} is in another guild."

-	kick_player(player_name: String)
o	Remove the player from the guild. Return "Player {player_name} has been removed from the guild.". Remember to change the player's guild in the player class to "Unaffiliated".
o	If the is not a player with that name in the guild, return "Player {player_name} is not in the guild."

-	guild_info() 
o	Returns the guild's information, including the players in the guild, in this format:
"Guild: {guild_name}
 {player's info}"
